## Why Modular?

Starting a new web application usually means tackling a bunch of common yet crucial tasks, including:

-   **Scalable Architecture:** Structuring your application in a way that scales seamlessly with growth.
-   **Robust Access Control:** Crafting a granular ACL (Access Control List) to manage users and roles proficiently.
-   **Intuitive Admin Panel:** Either customizing a ready-made or developing a bespoke Admin Panel to streamline your application's construction.
-   **Responsive Design:** Ensuring your Admin Panel is mobile-friendly and responsive across devices.
-   **Unified UI Toolkit:** Adopting or developing a UI Toolkit to fast-track frontend development while maintaining a coherent design across pages.
-   **Effortless Frontend-Backend Integration:** Bridging your frontend and backend intuitively, ensuring a maintainable and straightforward connection.
-   **Optimized Build Management:** Harnessing the right toolset and stack to manage your frontend application's build steps efficiently.
-   **Reusable Components:** Abstracting common functionalities and components for reuse (embrace DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself), such as data search, pagination, flash messages, and more.
-   **Thorough Testing Frameworks:** Implementing testing frameworks to validate your application's functionality.
-   **Comprehensive Activity Log:** Keeping a detailed log to audit user operations.
-   **Clear Architectural Vision:** Maintaining a lucid mental model of the project's architectural decisions, promoting consistency and a solid understanding of how all elements interlink.

The intricacies of these tasks are far from trivial, often demanding a substantial amount of time and attention. As you delve deeper, you may encounter additional minor behaviors and tweaks that, while seemingly marginal, are crucial and time-consuming.

Furthermore, more complex scenarios such as multi-faceted dashboards tailored to user profiles or intricate business rules may arise, adding layers of complexity to your project.

Modular aims to alleviate these hurdles by providing a well-structured, comprehensive solution, allowing you to focus on what truly matters - bringing your unique application to life.

## Why VILT Stack (Vue, Inertia, Laravel, Tailwind)?

The VILT Stack is a powerful combination of frameworks and tools that provide a robust foundation for building web applications. These technologies **work very well together** to deliver a seamless developer experience, enabling you to concentrate on your application's core functionalities. Moreover, after developing projects of varying sizes and complexities with different stacks, I discovered that the VILT Stack is incredibly flexible. It accommodates simple CRUD applications just as well as it does more complex UIs, with enhanced interactivity and client-side heavy business logic (interactive calendars, dynamic form fields, complex graphics, etc.). Consequently, it scales adeptly in both scenarios, proving to be a reliable choice for both small, straightforward apps and large, complex ones.

## About Modular

Modular stands on the shoulders of giants, integrating powerful frameworks and tools to offer a streamlined development experience. Here’s what lies under the hood:

-   [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (Drives custom frontend components)
-   [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) (Bridges the gap between frontend and backend)
-   [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/) (Empowers the backend)
-   [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) (Styles with ease)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Accelerates frontend tooling)

When you bring Modular into your Laravel application, here’s a taste of what you'll unlock:

-   A **Themed Admin Panel** seamlessly integrated with Tailwind CSS, ready to assist you in crafting your application.
-   A finely-tuned **ACL (Access Control List) System** to effortlessly manage users and roles.
-   A suite of auto-loaded **Custom Vue 3 Components**, penned in **JavaScript**, and tailored with Tailwind CSS; ready for use.
-   Vite for a **lightning-fast frontend development** journey.
-   Inertia.js to ensure a smooth frontend and backend connection, **simplifying routing and component data hydration**, among other benefits.
-   A **custom-built CLI** to swiftly generate new modules; propelling your **development speed**.
-   A comprehensive **translation system** ready to help your application speak the world's languages (if needed).
-   **Build steps** for your frontend application are set, pre-configured, and ready to roll from the get-go, with the right tooling and stack to keep the momentum high.
-   A **developer experience** designed to leave a grin on your face at the end of each coding day ;)

## Custom Vue 3 Components

In previous iterations of Modular, I leveraged robust UI Toolkits like Vuetify and Prime Vue. While these are excellent options, a desire for more control over the components led to a change, guided by the following criteria:

-   Adoption of Vue 3 as the primary JavaScript framework.
-   Employment of Tailwind CSS for styling purposes.
-   Seamless integration of Custom Vue 3 Components with the Tailwind Theme System.
-   Easy customization of components by merely editing them. To facilitate this, components reside not in node_modules, but in "./resources/js/Components". Need some tweaking? Open the component, modify the Tailwind CSS classes, and save it. Done.
-   No use of Sass, Less, Stylus, etc. Tailwind CSS exclusively.
-   No TypeScript. Pure JavaScript only.
-   Light and exceedingly straightforward Common Components. If necessary, extend or create new components per project to imbue additional functionality.

At present, Modular furnishes the following Custom Vue 3 Components:

```bash
./resources/js/Components
