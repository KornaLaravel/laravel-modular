## About Modular

Modular is a collection of practices and tools to build web applications in a modular, reusable and structured way.

This project has a focus on developer experience, and provides an alternative to connect different parts of your applications using a simple and intuitive way.

In simple words, after installing Modular the Modular Composer package, you will get out of the box:

-   A themed Admin Panel to build your application
-   A granular ACL (Access Control List) system to manage users and roles
-   A solid UI library with auto loaded components
-   Auto loaded custom Vue 3 components on the fly
-   Vite connected for lightning fast frontend development
-   Inertia.js connected for a seamless frontend and backend connection, with easier routing
-   A tailor made CLI to help new modules generation
-   A developer experience that puts a smile on your face at the end of the day ;)

Modular is built on top of the following frameworks and tools:

-   [Laravel 10](https://laravel.com/) (For the backend)
-   [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) (For the frontend custom components)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (For the frontend tooling)
-   [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) (To simplify the connection between frontend and the backend)
-   [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com/) (For styling)
-   [PrimeVue](https://primefaces.org/primevue/) (For UI general Vue 3 components library)
